# Architecture Guide

Post-refactoring architecture for Culcul (BiliBili 3rd-party client). `lib/shared/` is fully retired.

## Layer Rules

### Dependency Direction

```
features/ → core/, ui/
app/      → features/, core/, ui/
core/     → (standalone, no feature imports)
ui/       → core/ (no feature imports)
```

### Feature Structure

Each feature follows this pattern:

```
features/<name>/
├── application/      # Workflows, commands (orchestration logic)
├── data/             # API clients, repositories, DTOs
│   ├── dtos/
│   └── repositories/
├── domain/           # Entities, repository interfaces
│   ├── entities/
│   └── repositories/
├── presentation/     # UI layer
│   ├── pages/
│   ├── view_models/
│   └── widgets/
├── route_entry.dart  # Router-facing seam
└── feature_scope.dart # Feature-level provider scope
```

### Route Ownership

- `lib/app/router/app_routes.dart` is the top-level route graph
- Each feature exposes `route_entry.dart` as the router-facing seam
- Route entry files translate route params to page constructor args
- Route entry files are thin adapters — no workflow logic

### Orchestration Ownership

- Pages gather UI state and invoke one workflow/command object
- Mutation sequencing, login gating, branching → `application/`
- Shared widgets must not absorb feature workflows

## Migration History

The `lib/shared/` directory was retired across phases 0-3:
- **Phase 1**: Decoupled shared boundaries (auth, video, network)
- **Phase 2**: Route seams, orchestration extraction, provider normalization
- **Phase 3**: Structural moves (constants, utils, hooks, pagination, network, services, theme, widgets)

Archived docs: `docs/architecture/archive/`

## Phase 3 Focus (Current)

1. Testing foundation — architecture guard tests
2. Unit tests for core services
3. Widget tests for shared UI
4. CI pipeline (GitHub Actions)
5. TODO/FIXME cleanup
6. Documentation refresh
